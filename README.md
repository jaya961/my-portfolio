# Jayachandra Reddy K - Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, hosted on GitHub Pages.

**Live Site:** [https://jaya961.github.io/my-portfolio/](https://jaya961.github.io/my-portfolio/)

## Project Structure
-   `index.html`: Contains all the text and content (Bio, Experience, Skills). **Edit this file to change your info.**
-   `style.css`: Contains all the colors, fonts, and layout styles.
-   `script.js`: Handles the mobile menu and animations.

## How to Update Your Website

### 1. Make Changes Locally
1.  Open the folder in VS Code.
2.  Edit `index.html` to update your text (e.g., add a new job, change your bio).
3.  Save the file.
4.  Open `index.html` in your browser to verify the changes look good.

### 2. Publish Changes to GitHub
Once you are happy with your changes, run these 3 commands in your terminal to update the live site:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated profile details"
git push
```

*Note: It may take 1-2 minutes for the changes to appear on the live website.*
